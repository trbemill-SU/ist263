      <h1>Easy Repairs</h1><hr>
        <p id="main"><strong>Short Description</strong><br>
        Here I would have the steps of doing the easier car fixes.  </p><br>
      <h2>Oil Change</h2>

      
      <p>
        Tools and Materials You'll Need:<br>
	Funnel<br>
	Oil<br>
	Oil filter<br>
	Wrench/socket set<br>
	Car jack<br>
	Oil pan<br>
Oil filter wrench<br>

For information on oil, oil filter, and socket size needed look into the cars owner manual. Usually the socket size is 10mm.<br>
<strong>Step 1. Prepare your car. </strong>

	Raize car up with a jack and open the oil cap found at the top of the engine.
	Place the oil pan underneath the oil reservoir. This is located under the engine.<br>
    <strong>Step 2. Drain Oil.</strong>

	With socket set and wrench take out the oil screw and let oil drain into oil pan.<br>
    <strong>Step 3. Oil Filter</strong>

	While the oil is draining you can change the filter. 
	Take the filter out of the box and locate the o ring. This is a rubber band looking part. Take some of the old oil and rub it around the o ring. This will help with the seal. 
	The oil filter can be located at the top or bottom of the car just depending on the car. 
	Once located, unscrew the filter with the oil filter wrench and replace the old filter with the new one.<br>
    <strong>Step 4. Add New Oil</strong>

	Make sure You have the oil screw back in and the oil filter is screwed in. Make sure not to over tighten any of these. 
	Pour in the correct kind of oil into the oil opening at the top of the engine. Also, make sure the correct amount is being added. This info can be found in the car manual. <br>
    <strong>Step 5. Finishing Up</strong>

	Lastly, close the lid and turn on the car. We want to let the car run for a couple of minutes to let the car circulate the new oil throughout the engine. After its warmed up we can shut off the car and check the dip stick to make sure the oil looks good. The oil level should be within the hatched area and should be an amber color.<br>

    <h2>Tire Repair</h2><br>
      <p>
        If you get a flat tire then you have 3 options. Tow truck, change the tire, or fix the tire.
        The tire fix is temporary but will allow you to drive home or to a nearby gas station. <br>
        
            For the Tire fix I recommend having and using the Slime deluxe tire plug kit. This will help you easily fix any small puncture from things like glass or nails. A simple step process for this is: locate the puncture, prep the hole, then use the tool to plug the hole. From here I recommend having an electric tire pump for when a lot of air is released. Lastly, make sure to cut off any excess rubber from the plug.<br>
        
            In order to change a tire you will need very little. You will need: spare tire, jack, and a tire iron. With these three items it's as easy as jacking the car up, removing the 5 nuts and putting on the spare. Make sure the nuts are snug so the tire doesn't wobble when driving.<br>
        </p>
      <h2>Spark Plugs </h2><br>
      <p>
        Tools and Materials You'll Need:<br>

        New spark plugs <br>
        Spark plug socket and ratchet or a spark plug wrench<br>
        Spark plug gap tool if not pre-gapped<br>
        Extension bar if needed<br>
        Socket set<br>
        Steps:<br>
        <strong>Step 1. Locate the Spark Plugs:</strong>
        
            Car should be off
        In most cars, the spark plugs are located on top of the engine, connected to spark plug wires or coil packs.<br>
        <strong>Step 2. Remove the Spark Plug Wires/Coil Packs:</strong>
        
        
        If your vehicle uses spark plug wires, gently pull the wire boot off the old spark plug by grasping the boot, not the wire. If your vehicle uses coil packs, unplug the electrical connector to the coil pack and remove any retaining bolts or screws holding the coil pack in place.<br>
        <strong>Step 3. Remove the Old Spark Plugs:</strong>
        
        
        Attach the spark plug socket to your ratchet or spark plug wrench.
        Carefully insert the socket over the spark plug and turn it counterclockwise to loosen and remove the old spark plug.<br>
        <strong>Step 4. Check the Spark Plug Gap:</strong>
        
        
        Use a spark plug gap tool to check the gap of the new spark plugs. Adjust the gap if necessary to match your vehicle's specifications. Refer to your vehicle's manual for the correct gap size.<br>
        <strong>Step 5. Install the New Spark Plugs:</strong>
        
        
        Carefully thread the new spark plug into the spark plug socket, making sure not to cross-thread it. Hand-tighten the spark plug into the engine.
        If you're using a torque wrench, refer to your vehicle's manual for the recommended torque specification and tighten the spark plug to the specified torque.
        If you're not using a torque wrench, tighten the spark plug snugly by hand and then give it an additional 1/8 to 1/4 turn with the ratchet or spark plug wrench.<br>
        <strong>Step 6. Reattach Spark Plug Wires or Coil Packs:</strong>
        
        
        If you have spark plug wires, slide the wire boot onto the new spark plug until it clicks into place.
        If you have coil packs, reattach them and secure them with any retaining bolts or screws.
        If your spark plug wires have numbers or labels, make sure they are reconnected to the correct spark plug.<br>
        
        Repeat for the Remaining Spark Plugs<br>
        <strong>Step 7. Start the Engine:</strong>
        
        
        Once all the new spark plugs are installed and everything is reconnected, start the engine to ensure it runs smoothly. Listen for any unusual noises or misfires.<br>
