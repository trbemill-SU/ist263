<h1>Tough Fixes</h1>
<hr>
<p id="main">
    <strong>Short Description</strong><br>
    Here I would have the steps of doing the harder car fixes that would require more equipment. I would also show pictures to help. This would be a step by step process mostly using lists.
    
</p>
<h2>Antifreeze</h2>
<p>
<strong>Tools and Materials You'll Need:</strong><br>
New antifreeze/coolant <br>
Funnel<br>
Drain pan<br>
Pliers or a screwdriver<br>

Safety Precautions:
Ensure that the engine is completely cool before starting the process. Opening the cooling system when the engine is hot can result in burns.<br>

<strong>Step 1. Locate the Radiator Drain Plug:</strong>

The radiator drain plug is typically located at the bottom of the radiator. Consult your vehicle's manual if you're unsure about its location.<br>
Position the Drain Pan:

Place the drain pan underneath the radiator drain plug to catch the old antifreeze.<br>

<strong>Step 2. Open the Radiator Drain Plug:</strong>

Use pliers or a screwdriver to loosen and remove the radiator drain plug. Be prepared for the old antifreeze to start draining into the pan.<br>

<strong>Step 3. Drain the Old Antifreeze:</strong>

Allow the old antifreeze to drain completely into the drain pan. This may take several minutes.
Flush the Cooling System (Optional):<br>

<strong>Step 4. Close the Radiator Drain Plug:</strong>

If you flushed the system, close the radiator drain plug. If not, skip to the next step.<br>

<strong>Step 5. Prepare the New Antifreeze:</strong>

Mix the new antifreeze with distilled water according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This ratio can vary depending on the type of antifreeze you're using.<br>

<strong>Step 6. Fill the Cooling System:</strong>

Using a funnel, slowly pour the mixed antifreeze into the radiator until it's full.
Start the engine and let it run with the radiator cap off until the thermostat opens and the coolant level drops. Add more antifreeze mixture as needed.<br>

<strong>Step 7. Bleed Air from the System:</strong>

To remove air bubbles from the cooling system, you may need to use a bleeder valve or follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific vehicle.<br>

<strong>Step 8. Close the Radiator Cap:</strong>

Once the air is purged from the system, close the radiator cap securely.<br>

<strong>Step 9. Check the Overflow Reservoir:</strong>

Ensure that the coolant level in the overflow reservoir is at the recommended level as indicated on the reservoir itself.<br>

<strong>Step 10. Dispose of the Old Antifreeze:</strong>

Properly dispose of the old antifreeze according to local regulations. Many auto parts stores accept used antifreeze for recycling.<br>
<strong>Step 11. Finishing Up:</strong>

Start the engine and inspect for any coolant leaks around the radiator and hoses.
Record the date and mileage of the antifreeze change in your vehicle's maintenance log.<br>

<h2>Brake Fluid</h2>
    <p>Tools and Materials You'll Need:<br>
        New brake fluid <br>
        Brake bleeding kit <br>
        Wrench or socket set<br>
        Turkey baster or brake fluid siphon tool<br>
        Clear plastic tubing (if not using a brake bleeding kit)<br>
        Brake fluid catch container<br>
        Jack and jack stands or ramps <br>
        Wheel chocks<br>
        
        Safety Precautions:<br>
        
        Ensure that the car is parked on a level surface and the parking brake is engaged.
        Use wheel chocks to prevent the car from rolling.
        
    <strong>Step 1. Locate the Brake Fluid Reservoir:</strong>
        
        The brake fluid reservoir is typically located near the firewall on the driver's side of the engine bay. Consult your vehicle's manual if you're unsure about its location.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 2. Check the Brake Fluid Level:</strong>
        
        Open the brake fluid reservoir cap and check the fluid level. It should be between the minimum and maximum marks. If it's below the minimum mark, add a small amount of the new brake fluid to bring it up to the correct level.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 3. Raise the Car (If Necessary):</strong>
        
        Depending on your vehicle, you may need to raise it using a jack and secure it on jack stands or use ramps to access the brake calipers and bleeders easily. Always follow proper safety procedures when working under a vehicle.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 4. Prepare for Bleeding:</strong>
        
        Brake bleeding is the process of removing old brake fluid from the brake lines and replacing it with new fluid. You can do this with a brake bleeding kit or manually with a helper.<br>
        If using a brake bleeding kit, follow the manufacturer's instructions for setup.
        
    <strong>Step 5. Open the Brake Bleeder Valve:</strong>
        
        Starting with the brake farthest from the master cylinder (usually the rear passenger side), use a wrench to open the bleeder valve on the brake caliper or wheel cylinder.
        Attach a piece of clear plastic tubing to the bleeder valve to direct the old fluid into a catch container. If using a brake bleeding kit, follow the kit's instructions.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 6. Bleed the Brake:</strong>
        
        Have a helper slowly press the brake pedal down and hold it.
        While the brake pedal is held down, open the bleeder valve slightly to allow the old brake fluid to flow into the tubing or the kit's reservoir.
        Close the bleeder valve before your helper releases the brake pedal.
        Repeat this process until clear, clean brake fluid flows through the tubing without air bubbles. This may take several repetitions for each wheel.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 7. Repeat for All Wheels:</strong>
        Move to the next wheel in the sequence (usually rear driver's side, front passenger's side, and finally front driver's side) and repeat the bleeding process.
        Ensure you maintain the brake fluid level in the reservoir during the process, adding more new fluid as needed.<br>
        
    <strong> Step 8. Check the Fluid Level and Tighten Bleeder Valves:</strong>
        
        After bleeding all four wheels, check the brake fluid reservoir again and top it off to the correct level.
        Tighten the bleeder valves on each wheel securely.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 9. Replace the Reservoir Cap:</strong>
        Put the cap back on the brake fluid reservoir and tighten it securely<br>
        </p>
    <h2>Power Steering Fluid</h2>
    <p>Tools and Materials You'll Need:<br>
        New power steering fluid<br>
        Turkey baster or a syringe<br>
        Plastic tubing or a suitable container for draining the old fluid<br>
        Jack and jack stands or ramps (if needed)<br>
        Wheel chocks<br>
        Steps:
        
        Safety Precautions:
        
        Ensure that the car is parked on a level surface, the parking brake is engaged, and the wheels are chocked to prevent rolling.
        
    <strong>Step 1. Locate the Power Steering Reservoir:</strong>
        
        The power steering reservoir is typically located in the engine bay. Consult your vehicle's manual if you're unsure about its location.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 2. Check the Fluid Level:</strong>
        
        Open the power steering reservoir cap and check the fluid level. Note that some reservoirs have a dipstick built into the cap.
        If the fluid level is low, add a small amount of the new power steering fluid to bring it up to the correct level.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 3. Locate the Power Steering Return Hose:</strong>
        
        The power steering return hose is typically connected to the power steering reservoir. It's the hose that returns the old fluid from the power steering system back to the reservoir.
        Identify the end of the hose that connects to the reservoir.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 4. Drain the Old Fluid:</strong>
        
        You can drain the old power steering fluid by disconnecting the return hose from the reservoir or by using a turkey baster or syringe.
        If using the turkey baster or syringe method, insert the tool into the reservoir and draw out as much of the old fluid as possible. Dispose of the old fluid properly.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 5. Refill the Reservoir:</strong>
        
        Add the new power steering fluid to the reservoir, filling it to the recommended level.<br>
        
    <strong> Step 6. Start the Engine:</strong>
        
        Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes with the wheels straight (not turned).
        Turn the steering wheel from lock to lock several times. This will help circulate the new fluid throughout the system and expel any remaining old fluid.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 7. Check the Fluid Level:</strong>
        
        After turning the steering wheel and running the engine for a few minutes, check the power steering fluid level again. Top it off as needed.<br>
        
    <strong>Step 8. Replace the Reservoir Cap and done:</strong>
        
        Put the cap back on the power steering reservoir and tighten it.<br>
